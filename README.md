Online Issue-Voting Platform to Better Democracy

Eventually, hopefully this will be a very large website, which I like to describe as the 'Wikipedia of public opinion'. One person, one vote, on just about any issue, collaboratively generated, edited, published and voted upon.

The first iteration of this app will be the deployment of a dynamic website through the use of GitHub Pages and FireBase.
