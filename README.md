Online Issue-Voting Platform to Better Democracy

Eventually, hopefully this will be a very large website, which I like to describe as the 'Wikipedia of public opinion'. One person, one vote, on just about any issue, collaboratively generated, edited, published and voted upon.

The first iteration of this app will be the deployment of a static website through Github pages.

After that I'll be looking to expand on that one and making it dynamic, supported by Firebase.

The next step would be to switch to a paid service.

I intend to create the app using fullstack MEVN.
