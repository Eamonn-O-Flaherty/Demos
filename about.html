    <h2>About Demos</h2>

    <p><strong>Demos</strong> is an attempt to learn what people want from their politics, and to allow them to be heard on what matters
    to them.</p>
    
    <p>By allowing us to clearly express ourselves on issues- and them being issues of our choosing- we can improve our
    democratic systems, and make society as a whole more democratic, responsive to our needs and just generally make
    a better world.</p>
    
    <p>You'd be able to vote on any issue, from hyper-local in your street right on through to global issues. In as
    much detail as you like and from the comfort of your home or phone.</p>
    
    <p>These votes are of a polling nature essentially- no explicit hard/executive power, but rather a vastly improved
    organisation and execution of soft power.</p>
    
    <p>We'll be able to do lots of things better through <strong>Demos</strong>: expand the national discussion (and make a meaningful
    contribution to an international discussion); focus attention on what we want; keep all of the energy expended
    on online petitions alive by keeping them as living documents and have a meaningful contribution to the
    drafting of legislation.</p>
    
    <h3>Expand and Improve the National Political Discussion</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Demos</strong> will help to take the agenda away from media companies, advertising agencies/PR firms and politicians
    allowing
    us to vote about what we choose. Less short-term/ latest news discussions, and more long-term issues instead. We
    can discuss issues and suggest changes which would otherwise be avoided as the powerful find them embarrassing or
    threatening.</p>
    
    <h3>Better Online Petitions</h3>
    
    <p>Right now the politically engaged can expand vast resources on amassing signatures for a single petition, which
    once completed passes into the hands of representatives with at best an even chance of ever being acted upon or
    heard form again.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Demos</strong> changes the dynamic by posing questions which will remain as ongoing point to amass support. They can also
    be more meaningful by demonstrating opposition too, which can underscore the true level of support on any topic.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Citizen drafting, input and polling on legislation</h3>
    
    <p>There are lots of applications which excite me about Demos, and this is one of them: allow citizens to draft
    and/or vote on bills, through linked questions.</p>
    
    <p>These questions could be simple layman's way of unsderstanding the issue, which is then described in more detail and so on until we can also vote on the same text representatives will vote upon.</p>
    
    <h3>Clearing up a Common Confusion</h3>
    
    <p>I want to make clear the two things which <strong>Demos</strong> is <strong>not</strong> about for me: Online Voting where we
    elect our representatives or Online Direct Democracy where we replace representatives with Demos. Those are not
    things I want personally, and is a different discussion.</p>
    
    <p>Happily, if you are a supporter of such things Demos is still for you as it creates the sort of infrastructure
    needed and the scope to have a meaningful discussion on those ideas.</p>
    
    <h3>State of development</h3>
    
    <p>This is a mock-up site and serves as a demonstration of the basic concepts involved, made possible by my recent
    beginning in learning to code. The next step will be in converting it into a proper dynamic website with a
    back-end supported by Firebase, and adding functionality as my skills grow- and whatever contribution others are
    willing to offer.</p>
    
    <p>I'm intending to build it via full-stack MEVN. </p>
    <br>
    
    <p>I hope you like the idea and will get involved in whatever capacity suits you. If you're a programmer you can
    have a look at the project on <a href="https://github.com/" target='_blank'>GitHub</a> and can
    otherwise register to become a user when the site goes live by <a href="mailing-list.html">joining my mailing
    list</a> . I'm a member of the <a href="https://www.progcode.org/">Progressive Coders
    Network</a> and you can find me on their Slack too.</p>
    <p>Cheers, <br>
