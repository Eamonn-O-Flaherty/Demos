    <h1> Demos</h1>
    <h2>What is the will of the people?</h2>
    
    <p>Our Democracy is good, but it could be better.
       
      As part of the Better Democracy campaign 
      Demos will allow us to vote on topics of 
      our choosing -
      in as much detail as we want - so as to inform 
      ourselves, each other
      and our elected representatives as to our view 
      on things.</p>

      <p>It is to be used alongside our current system, and is
      a better way of:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>petioning </li>
        <li>polling</li>
        <li>organising</li>
      </ul> 
      
      <p>It is a quick, accurate and easy way of 
        expressing the <b>will of the people</b>.</p>
